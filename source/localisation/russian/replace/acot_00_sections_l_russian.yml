  tech_acot_ship_isc_desc: "By default, strike crafts are too small to be equipped with standard-issued FTL systems and must rely on parent carrier ships for interstellar travels.

  tech_acot_ship_unlock_t_desc: "Although the current Titan design is in theory already capable of fielding the massive firepower of a titanic-class weaponry. The tests so far have been mixed in results, for indeed it was our miscalculations that the level of power required would be equal to that of twin battleship spinal weapon. Even still, we must be cautious and the titan hull must be further reinforced."
  tech_acot_ship_unlock_t_turret: "T-Class Macrolance Turret"
  tech_acot_ship_unlock_t_turret_desc: "This may be a very brilliant, or awful idea, but some of the science teams believe they can make a version of titanic-sized weapons that do not require the spinal bow by using the ship's interior itself as a massive capacitor. Much like before, this will prevent most of the defense systems to be installed on the sections, but perhaps the firepower is worth the price. Furthermore, based on this theory, even a battleship's spinal charge can be altered in the same way to support titanic-weapons."
  tech_acot_ship_unlock_xl: "Spinal Bow Implementation"
  tech_acot_ship_unlock_xl_desc: "The projected power surge required to field the XL-Class Weapon Systems cannot be done without modifying our battleship's bow to become a spinal lance. Such change is the only way for the weapon to be used without sacrificing any defensive components.\n\nTo ensure maximum safeties, every ships that are expected to field these weapons must also be improved to have extra hull reinforcements."
  tech_acot_ship_unlock_xl_turret: "XL-Class Microlance Turret"
  tech_acot_ship_unlock_xl_turret_desc: "Now that we are more familiar with the weapon systems, we can perhaps finally make adjustments to other ship sections to swap out AL turrets to that of XL. This will however come at the expense of reducing the numbers of available defensive systems.\n\nTo ensure maximum safeties, every ships that are expected to field these weapons must also be improved to have extra hull reinforcements."
