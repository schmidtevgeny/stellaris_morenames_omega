  tech_hull_power_se_desc: "One of the more peculiar concepts that gets brought up is the idea of shooting two birds with one stone and solve the issues of increasingly demanding power consumption of ships as well as the ship's hull integrity at the same time. In the past, trying to tackle these issues typically results in massively increasing the costs or alterations of the ship's overall physical shapes that make them unfeasible. But with some tinkering with dimensional space, perhaps it will be possible to create a new type of hull platings that not only provide increased durability, but also doubles as powerful power generators without compromising the ship's hardpoints."

  tech_mass_accelerator_se_desc: "There is only so much pure kinetic force can do as ship protections and defenses keep getting stronger and energy weapons quickly dominating the fields, our scientists seek better ways to improve our current mass accelerators. While the concept sounds weird and quite dumb, it may be possible to instead turn the entire cannon into a powerful warphole generator that can tear a fabric of space and sends the warhead inside enemy ship, bypassing shields and travelling distance completely. The only issue as of now, is how to do that while still maintaining the speed and velocity of the projectile?"
  tech_mass_driver_se: "Sigma Kinetic Blaster"
  tech_mass_driver_se_desc: "No longer content with relying fully on pure kinetic force, Sigma Kinetic Blaster utilizes new types of munitions.

  tech_thrusters_se: "Sigma Thrusters"
  tech_thrusters_se_desc: "Since stars are everywhere and thrusters are designed for subspace travelling, it is natural that we simply develop thrusters that draw power of the stars themselves and bind them to our will."
  tech_titan_accelerator_se: "Titanic-Sized Warp Cannon"
  tech_titan_accelerator_se_desc: "On larger ships with stronger generators and more room for spinal cannon, it is possible to supercharge the artillery shell with volatile stellarite energies up to critical level before firing the weapon.
