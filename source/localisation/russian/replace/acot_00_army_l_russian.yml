Fortunately, some of our scientists have draft a plan to create an iconic beacon of peace well suited for convincing the others that peace is the only way. It sounds quite silly, but the projected data does prove to be reliable."
  tech_acot_army_phile: "Ghost Division"
  tech_acot_army_phile_desc: "We value all life, even those of the enemies. They must be allowed to see the errors of their ways, but we cannot perform such daring tasks with our current destructive weapons. To this end, we must develop and train armies specifically equipped to take down only hostile targets with extreme efficiency. We must have more elegant weapons of the civilized age. It's over, xenophobes - We have the high grounds."
  tech_acot_army_phile_hero: "The Black Widows"
  tech_acot_army_phile_hero_desc: "While we do not enjoy taking lives, we must admit that our neutralizers do enjoy ending the threats of xenophobic bigots. The official formation of the Division as a truly independent force will allow us to draw from our veteran ghosts to become Black Widows."
  tech_acot_army_phobe: "Scorn of Xeno"
  tech_acot_army_phobe_desc: "Our people have accepted the simple fact that we are the only truly civilized species in this universe, all others are simply animals - beasts that existed to be purged. But purging these beasts requires a deadlier force, one that will purify the xeno taint and strike fear in the hearts of those of them that would dare raise their hand against us. When our forces come, they will beg for death."
  tech_acot_army_phobe_hero: "Scorched Earth"
  tech_acot_army_phobe_hero_desc: "We have wasted enough time trying to bombard planets with shield generators or storming against the insect's hives. Our military strategists ask that we create a new weapon. A titanic-sized artillery capable of raining down murder and mayhem upon the trash that is our enemy. Collateral Damage be damned, for they chose to be born a xeno scum."
  tech_acot_army_psi: "Dark Disciples"
  tech_acot_army_psi_desc: "Psi Warriors, while already formidable due to their ability to communicate telepathically and destroy the enemy's morale, are still vulnerable to machine or genetic soldiers. We must start training new generations of psionic warriors who are able to use their psionic powers in a more direct fashion to attack our enemies."
  tech_acot_army_psi_hero: "The Second Gift"
  tech_acot_army_psi_hero_desc: "We have received interesting news, recently there's a report that the Shroud has chosen another individual, from within the ranks of our dark disciples as another avatar. While not as powerful as the original chosen one, this one possesses much more destructive power. We should seek this disciple out without delay."
  tech_acot_army_robotic_ae: "Alpha Assault Templates"
  tech_acot_army_robotic_ae_desc: "We will surpass the precursors in every category, robotics included."
  tech_acot_army_robotic_dm: "Delta Assault Template"
  tech_acot_army_robotic_dm_desc: "It is amazing that there are records that the precursors have achieved such advancement in robotic technologies, records suggest their machines are as advanced as any organic life...yet they are fully loyal to their creators with no desire for independence. Perhaps there is something unique about them? We must dig deeper."
  tech_acot_army_robotic_se: "Sigma Assault Templates"
  tech_acot_army_robotic_se_desc: "Let it be known that even our most primitive robots are stuffs of legends."
  tech_acot_army_se: "Sigma Army"
  tech_acot_army_se_desc: "Surface weapons, hand-held equipment and power suits powered by stellarite energy. We will bring the second sun atop the enemy's ground fortifications."
  tech_acot_army_spirit: "Inquisitorius Order Formation"
  tech_acot_army_spirit_desc: "While our empire already has dedicated priests who help guide our people towards greater purpose, we see the possibilities of creating a new religious sect that works directly with the military using these new dark matter energies."
  tech_acot_army_spirit_hero: "Chosen of the Faith"
  tech_acot_army_spirit_hero_desc: "Even amongst the most faithful of our people, there are some who's not only devoted to the faith but seem to be favored and chosen by the spirits themselves. Tales of saints, displaying auras of holiness spread across our systems. We should quickly seek them out and properly sanctify them as the rightful saints of our holy order."
  tech_acot_army_stellarite_bomber: "Stellarite Strikers"
  tech_acot_army_stellarite_bomber_desc: "Sometimes we can ill afford to wage conventional ground battles, and victory over our enemies must come at any costs. Fast, lightly-armored, expendable automated aircrafts can be constructed to deploy volatile stellarite bomb on the battlefield to quickly annihilate our enemies and the planet surface."
  tech_acot_army_synth: "Synth Combat Platform"
  tech_acot_army_synth_desc: "Omnidroids are flexible and capable of complex movements but are still limited by their cumbersome sizes and certain AI flaws. Perhaps if we instead make use of true synthetic who despite being vulnerable to morale drop, can be much more effective soldiers."
  tech_acot_army_synth_hero: "Synth Reapers"
  tech_acot_army_synth_hero_desc: "Synth Reapers are the deadliest combat platform any synth personality matrix can hope to commandeer. Towering above most other units, they make short work of their enemies with overwhelming firepower."
  tech_ae_army_armor: "Advanced Combat Suits"
  tech_ae_army_armor_desc: "Although we have been utilizing infantry-scale personal shield generators for quite awhile since the early years of our space advent, they were heavily limited in terms of durability. Now that nanotechs and dimensional systems become more widespread, we can finally create vehicle-scaled defensive systems that can be installed on most standard army's battlesuits. The major benefits is that it will drastically increase the ability for pilotted crews to survive their vehicle's destruction."
  tech_ae_army_armor_tooltip: "Upgrades pilotted vehicles to always allow their pilots to survive their vehicle's destruction, as well as increasing  the likelihood of other infantry garrisons to survive as well."
  tech_ae_army_hive_supercell: "Enhanced Reconstitution Sequences"
  tech_ae_army_hive_supercell_desc: "Thanks to superior understanding of genetics and sequence spinning, it will soon be possible for larger hive warriors to survive after major breakdown of physical biomass. When sustaining fatal damages, the broodlings will attempt to merge together into a cocoon and draw upon nearby biomass to revive themselves into a new hive warrior. Although the process is not perfect, it will provide extra survivability for our warriors."
  tech_ae_army_hive_supercell_tooltip: "Large Hive units now has a chance to survive as cocoons. While these cocoons has little offensive powers, if they survive, they will morph back into their original units for free."
  tech_ae_army_machine_durability: "Avenger System"
  tech_ae_army_machine_durability_desc: "Although most combat platforms can survive with some of their mechanical limbs and joints destroyed, the chance is currently relatively on the lower end. "
  tech_ae_army_machine_durability_tooltip: "Increases the chances for all infantry unit platforms to survive as their damaged counterparts to continue the fight and possibly be repaired later."
  tech_infantry_alpha_capacitor: "Alpha Autosuits"
  tech_infantry_alpha_capacitor_desc: "Autosuits is rather new concept that involves the armors working in tandem with the wearers through either limited AI or remote control system from command centers. The Autosuits are able to handle their own maintenances and repairs, cutting down upkeep costs. But the true benefit is that, in times of war, if the suit manages to function despite the soldier's untimely demise, they will still be able to continue fighting as a mechanized unit."
  tech_infantry_alpha_capacitor_tooltip: "All non-expendable infantry units now have a chance for their combat suits to survive their deaths and continue to fight. The stats of the autosuit depends on the type of infantry, with Light being the weakest and Heavy being the strongest. The wearer's personal strength has no bearing on the suit's performance, however, so a rank and file soldier and a special unit that shares similar armor will spawn the same autosuit type."
  tech_infantry_ferocity: "Unyielding Ferocity"
