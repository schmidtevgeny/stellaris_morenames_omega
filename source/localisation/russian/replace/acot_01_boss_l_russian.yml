These lifeless husks could however be partially returned to life through essence reinvigoration procedure at the cost of permanent growth suspension. These zombie larvas could prove to be useful if proper stimulations could be used to coerce them to function as living weapons. They could tear into space vessel's hulls and make short work of our enemies."

Subject most likely will expire within two standard galactic year. This is unacceptable.\n\nClass-12 Dreampowder Serums must be regularly administered to pacify and maintain the Subject's mental stability. Automated Revitalization Systems will be used to ensure all critical organs will remain at acceptable conditions. Termination of non-essential organs will be recommended if necessary. Pain is preferable to death. Subject Bismarck must live up to at least 20,000 standard galactic year for the Project Bismarck to be successful. Failure is not an option, use any means necessary to prolong the subject. All other priorities, including subject's mental stability are secondary to the success of the project."
