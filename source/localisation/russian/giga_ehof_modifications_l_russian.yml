  ehof_travel.1002.1.DESC: "§H[this.GetName]§! detected a transmission from the §H[from.solar_system.GetName]§! system. Like the previous transmission, it disabled the ship's main systems; this time, the ship's $ehof_closed_modular$ was able to restore it to full functionality in short order. The ship's [Owner.GetScientistPlural] have labeled this phenomenon the $ehof_epcs$.\n\nAfter the §H[this.GetName]§! was brought back online, the $ehof_ep$ scanners aboard were able to locate the transmission's origin: a toxic world our surveyors have named §H[from.GetName]§!.\n\nFurther surveys incorporating the $ehof_ep$ scanners should be able to pinpoint the transmission's source. Since the transmission was very brief and has not repeated, it may take some time to do this."
  ehof_travel.1002.2.DESC: "Another $ehof_epcs$ transmission has been received by §H[this.GetName]§! in the §H[from.solar_system.GetName]§! system. Just like the previous two instances, the transmission disabled the ship. This time, however, an improved $ehof_closed_modular$ was able to restore the ship's functionality within a few minutes.\n\nThe $ehof_ep$ scanners were able to identify the source of the transmission inside the system: the shattered planet §H[from.GetName]§!. With further surveys, we will be able to locate the exact source on (or within) the planet - but it will take some time."
  ehof_travel.1002.3.DESC: "The §H[this.GetName]§! received another $ehof_epcs$ transmission from within the §H[from.solar_system.GetName]§! system. Our [Owner.GetScientistPlural] aboard the vessel determined that the transmission originated from a frozen planet named §H[from.GetName]§!.\n\nThe transmitter's exact location must be determined through further investigation before we can mount an expedition to it."
  ehof_travel.1002.4.DESC: "Another transmission of the $ehof_epcs$ has been detected inside the §H[from.solar_system.GetName]§! system by the §H[this.GetName]§!, this time appearing to be emitted from a molten world named §H[from.GetName]§!.\n\nThe ship's $ehof_ep$ scanners will be able to pinpoint its source, but it'll take some time to do so."
  ehof_travel.1002.5.DESC: "The §H[this.GetName]§! received another transmission of the $ehof_epcs$. This time, the transmission originated from a gas giant named §H[from.GetName]§! in the §H[from.solar_system.GetName]§! system.\n\nWe should investigate this source as soon as possible."
  ehof_travel.1002.6.DESC: "Upon entering the §H[root.solar_system.GetName]§! system, the §H[this.GetName]§! detected an $ehof_ep$ transmission - though strangely, this time it came from the surprisingly large brown dwarf at the system's center.\n\nWhile surveying the interior of such a barely-substellar object is daunting, we must nevertheless find the transmission's source and complete the $ehof_epcs$."

  ehof_travel.1004.DESC: "No entrance can be identified on the exterior of the $ehof_the_sphere$. It may be similar to the amplifier objects we observed in our studies of the $ehof_epcs$, whose entrances only manifest under specific conditions relating to the $ehof_ep$.\n\nIt will be necessary to study the structure so we can find a way into it, let alone determine its function. Our [Owner.GetResearchers] have decided to name the construct the $ehof_the_sphere_named$, based on the rippling, non-repeating patters that move across its surface."
