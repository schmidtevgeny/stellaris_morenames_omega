  prison_blokkat_is_baron: "§RUtterly Deranged§! - This Blokkat has a bizarre fascination with randomizing and twisting everything from its natural state. They also seem to have fashioned an air of aristocracy and elitism for themselves."
  prison_blokkat_is_bloblokkad: "§EScience Leader§! - This Blokkat seems to enjoy the pursuit of knowledge above all else. They can regularly be seen experimenting on 'primitives' or tinkering with some mad project."
  prison_blokkat_is_blokkepsii: "§EEmpathetic§! - This Blokkat seems to care deeply about other species, and devotes their time to studying them. Additionally, while still seemingly focused on harvest operations, they appear to be perfectly willing to assist other species in any way they can. "
  prison_blokkat_is_blokkimous: "§MMultiverse Enthusiast§! - This Blokkat appears to have found evidence that our universe is part of a sort of 'temporal multiverse' stretching into eternity and shows interest in studying this newfound phenomena."
  prison_blokkat_is_blokknight: "§LThe Blokknight Returns§! - This Blokkat seems to enjoy playing dress up, telling endless stories of deeds and valorous interactions with previous primitive civilisations. They also seem to have an unhealthy obsession with primitives arms and armor, constantly ensuring as much as pumped out as possible."
  prison_blokkat_is_blokkofett: "§HNewlink§! - This Blokkat was part of a spacefaring nation like ours who completed the Blokk-Protocols, and joined the Blokkats. This galactic harvesting operation is their first, and they have been assigned to study national entities."
  prison_blokkat_is_blokkutos: "§MDreamer§! - This Blokkat always has a sense of nostalgia for the past and dreams of a better future. Their dreams inspire unity, hope, and a fascination for the unknown to those in their presence."
  prison_blokkat_is_sophia: "§PRose Knight§! - This Blokkat, for whatever reason claims and enjoys being what its self refers to as a Rose Knight, seeming to know all methods of warfare down to ones that seem downright archaic in some fashion or the other. It seems rather indifferent to both aiding us, or aiding the Blokkats themselves in their harvesting operations. It also often requests simply to be called 'Rose' It has a fanatic desire to fire whatever it can fit into cannons at enemy ships, and also often runs away when it knows it's life is in danger. It also, For whatever reason enjoys attempting to ram ships into each other.\n\nLastly it claims that it wants to see 'The Greatest Sight anything could ever see' Everyone is stumped as to what that may be."
  prison_blokkat_is_yoru: "§RViciously Psychotic§! - This Blokkat appears to be hellbent on the ultimate annihilation of all forms of life. Why? Maybe it got pinged on the Blokkwork, maybe it burnt its blokktoast this morning, or maybe... it's just insane."
