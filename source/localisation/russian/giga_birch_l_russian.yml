  giga_birch.5001.a: "We see the Structure with new eyes."
  giga_birch.5001.desc: "Since the conclusion of the fourth expedition, significant progress has been made in the interpretation of the network map we discovered. Multiple candidate sites for important nodes have been plotted, and this new expedition will travel to the nearest.\n\nExpedition Leader [giga_birch_expedition_leader.GetName] will lead our [GigaGetExplorerPlural] to this prospective location, and determine whether our predictive models are correct.\n\nWe still don't know what form these nodes will take, or even if they have a physical presence that we could reasonably interact with, but confirming whether our suspicions are correct is worth the expenditure."
  giga_birch.5002: "Tracing the Network"
  giga_birch.5002.a: "This might just be what we are looking for."
  giga_birch.5002.desc: "Expedition Leader [giga_birch_expedition_leader.GetName] reports that our expedition has reached the approximate area of the predicted network node, and have encountered an unusual looking structure built into the main trunk of one of the machine level's spires.\n\nThe spire itself appears to be responsive, so accessing the strange structure shouldn't be an issue, but our [GigaGetExplorerPlural] are proceeding with caution."
  giga_birch.5003: "A Lack of Context"
  giga_birch.5003.a: "Our [GetResearchers] will decode this in no time."
  giga_birch.5003.b: "Perhaps the solution will reveal itself, in time."
  giga_birch.5003.b.desc: "Researching the £engineering_research£ §Y$tech_mega_engineering$§! Technology will allow us to continue this line of investigation."
  giga_birch.5003.desc: "Inside the unusual spire, our [GigaGetExplorerPlural] found what appears to be some kind of control center, apparently dedicated to managing the flow of resources and power through the Structure's systems. Our [GetResearchers] postulate that if we can crack the protocol used in the network, we could take control of those systems, and finally bring the Structure back to life."
  giga_birch.5003.desc.wait: "Inside the unusual spire, our [GigaGetExplorerPlural] found what appears to be some kind of control center, but they have so far been unable to determine what it actually does.\n\nExpedition Leader [giga_birch_expedition_leader.GetName] suggests that we do not attempt to interfere with this equipment without a better level of understanding, as the other candidate sites are both significantly further away, and may not be as intact."
  giga_birch.5004: "A New Lead"
  giga_birch.5004.a: "Our [GetResearchers] will decode this in no time."
  giga_birch.5004.desc: "New developments in structural engineering have given context to the control room that our expedition encountered some time ago, and it is now clear that the unknown data we could not understand was related to the distribution of resources within the Structure's systems.\n\nArmed with this new insight, we now believe we have what we need to decode the network protocol used to control those systems."
  giga_birch.5005: "The Network, Unveiled"
  giga_birch.5005.a: "We now understand our true goal."
  giga_birch.5005.desc: "A great web extends out before us; a constellation of a hundred billion tiny stars, joined together by fine threads of data. Nearly all are dimmed, with only a few scattered points flickering, holding out against the darkness.\n\nThis is the Structure's digital essence, its true shape. It is beautiful.\n\nIt is dying.\n\nOur local nodes are somewhat intact, and limping along in a low power state, unable to properly organize themselves without the guiding hand of the network at large. It has fallen into such a state of disrepair that the whole Structure is slowly decaying.\n\nThe energy required to save it would be far beyond anything we could provide, but if we could tap the source, bring the Structure's heart back to life, we might just be able to coax it into saving itself.\n\nIn the meantime, the trickle of power available to us should be more than enough to restart some of the automated systems in the node closest to our home."
  giga_birch.5006: "A New Era of Convenience"
  giga_birch.5006.a: "It is but a small taste of what awaits us."
  giga_birch.5006.desc: "Despite the gravity of the situation, today is a day to celebrate, as the first step has been taken in establishing our custodianship of the Structure. We now understand the basics of how it works, and what we must do to fix it, at least in the abstract.\n\nFrustratingly, these discoveries have done nothing to explain our own part in the Structure's storied history. The control center interfaces were so adaptive to the presence of our [GigaGetExplorerPlural] that we can't tell if their creators were even remotely similar to us.\n\nRegardless, the automated systems which we brought back online in our homeland have revolutionized all levels of our operations, greatly expanding our abilities."
  giga_birch.6001: "The Sixth Expedition"
  giga_birch.6001.a: "An unknown path, but a known goal."
  giga_birch.6001.desc: "The fifth expedition showed us that our true goal lies in reviving the heart of the Structure, bringing its power generation systems back online. The sixth expedition will set out to find that heart.\n\nThe network map we recovered from the control center on the machine layer has allowed us to pinpoint a distant spire which should allow access to deeper levels. From there, things get less certain, but there are a few likely locations for another command center to guide us further.\n\nExpedition Leader [giga_birch_expedition_leader.GetName] will lead our [GigaGetExplorerPlural] into the lower layers to establish a forward base of operations."
  giga_birch.6002: "A Layer of Ice"
  giga_birch.6002.a: "Unexpected, but also unsurprising."
  giga_birch.6002.desc: "Expedition Leader [giga_birch_expedition_leader.GetName] reports that the transit spire was successfully reached, and as before a group of [GigaGetExplorerPlural] were sent ahead of the main convoy as scouts.\n\nThis time only a single layer was accessible, where the [GigaGetExplorerPlural] were immediately greeted by a blizzard. Extended observation suggests that this layer is one full of ice and snow, with huge storm systems rolling across the landscape nearly continuously.\n\nThe adverse conditions may pose some problems for the expedition, but they are well prepared and remain highly motivated."
  giga_birch.6003: "Ghosts in the Snow"
  giga_birch.6003.a: "A tragedy which could have been avoided."
  giga_birch.6003.b: "If they were too stupid to survive, they deserved to die."
  giga_birch.6003.c: "Good riddance."
  giga_birch.6003.desc: "While travelling through the storm-swept arctic layer, our [GigaGetExplorerPlural] have encountered multiple abandoned settlements, far more commonly than on our home layer, and each seemingly built by a different culture at various levels of technological development.\n\nCuriously, none of them seem to be prepared for this kind of extreme weather, which has led Expedition Leader [giga_birch_expedition_leader.GetName] to suggest that their abandonment may be due to a shift in the environmental conditions some time in the last few centuries.\n\nThere is possibility a that such a shift may have been caused by deterioration of the Structure's environmental control systems, and that they could be fixed in future. The former inhabitants, however, are long gone."
  giga_birch.6004: "A Modicum of Shelter"
  giga_birch.6004.a: "We should cultivate these lichens."
  giga_birch.6004.a.desc: "Our outpost in the caverns will focus on producing £food£ §Y$food$§!.\n "
  giga_birch.6004.b: "Tap those gas wells."
  giga_birch.6004.b.desc: "Our outpost in the caverns will focus on producing £energy£ §Y$energy$§!.\n "
  giga_birch.6004.desc: "Expedition Leader [giga_birch_expedition_leader.GetName] reports that following a particularly intense blizzard, the expedition was forced to retreat into a canyon system, but in doing so stumbled across something interesting.\n\nThis particular canyon cuts through a series of large caves, which due to their sheltered position may be the best place found so far for a forward base. Additionally the caves appear to be host to a rich underground ecology, with many species of lichens surviving through chemosynthesis fuelled by a gas vent.\n\nIf we were to set up a base here, we could either harvest the lichens, or tap the gas wells directly to generate energy."
  giga_birch.7001: "The Seventh Expedition"
  giga_birch.7001.a: "We are close."
  giga_birch.7001.desc: "Aided by readings taken from our arctic layer forward base established during the sixth expedition, further analysis of the Structure network map has given us a solid lead on the location of a second command center.\n\nThe seventh expedition, headed by Expedition Leader [giga_birch_expedition_leader.GetName], will set out from the forward base with the goal of reaching and securing the command center."
  giga_birch.7002: "Trapped Beneath the Ice"
  giga_birch.7002.a: "Why is it down there?"
  giga_birch.7002.desc: "Expedition Leader [giga_birch_expedition_leader.GetName] reports that our [GigaGetExplorerPlural] have reached their destination. Initially unable to find anything, they eventually came across a large artificial structure at the bottom of a frozen lake a few tens of kilometers from the arrival point.\n\nIt is currently unclear whether this structure is another command center, as it is both significantly larger than the one on the machine level, and not attached to a spire.\n\nPreparations to send a group down to the sunken structure have already begun."
  giga_birch.7003: "An Ancient Observatory"
  giga_birch.7003.a: "That explains all the settlements, at least."
  giga_birch.7003.desc: "When our [GigaGetExplorerPlural] entered the structure on the lake bed, they were hoping to find another control center.\n\nWhat they found instead was far more localized, and potentially more directly useful for our own purposes.\n\nThe sunken facility appears to be some kind of observation station, connected to thousands of surveillance posts, most now offline, some corresponding in location to the ruined settlements common to the arctic layer. It would seem that they were some kind of grand experiment to study to development of primitive civilizations, with this as a nerve center for the operation. From what we can discern, this level was not always icy, lending credence to the environmental collapse hypothesis.\n\nEven in its run down state, this observatory still has a large array of intact computing hardware, and might be repurposed for our own use with some work."
  giga_birch.7004: "A Hit and a Miss"
  giga_birch.7004.a: "A temporary setback, with a silver lining."
  giga_birch.7004.desc: "It may not be another control center, but the observatory could be a valuable asset. Its computing power is formidable, and if any ancient data remain in its storage media, we stand to learn much.\n\nMore worryingly, the observatory's mission poses the question of whether we were also an experiment started long ago by the builders of this place. We can't rule it out, but we can't confirm it right now either.\n\nWe may have failed to reach our primary target, but armed with this new knowledge, it should be easier to find."
  giga_birch.7005: "Observatory Approach Finalized"
  giga_birch.7005.a: "It will be an important asset."
  giga_birch.7005.desc: "We have now reached the point of no return in our restoration of the ancient observatory. Past this point, further alterations to our plans would ruin our chances of repairing the facility, as many of the delicate instruments are still beyond our understanding."
  giga_birch.7005.desc.science: "$giga_birch.7005.desc$\n\nOnce completed, the facility will assist our [root.GetResearchers] in their studies."

  giga_birch.7006.a: "Excellent."
  giga_birch.7006.a.desc: "Our £district£ §Y$district_giga_origin_birch_lab_plural$§! on [situation.target.GetName] now produce additional resources."
  giga_birch.7006.desc: "Restoration efforts on the sunken observatory have come to a close, with the facility restored to full operational capacity - at least as much as our own technology will allow.\n\nIts plentiful processing power is already being put to use, and we expect it will remain a significant fixture in our empire for decades to come."
  giga_birch.800: "A Deeper Investigation"
  giga_birch.800.a: "We could learn a lot here."
  giga_birch.800.desc: "It's been a year since the official completion of our colonization efforts on [from.planet.GetName], and our colonists have been getting more familiar with the ancient arcology complex which shelters them from the storms and dangerous currents rolling across the planet's surface. Many questions about the huge oceanic structures remain unanswered, and the potential for scientific discovery is high.\n\nA site on one of the core platforms has been cleared out and prepared for further investigation."
  giga_birch.8001: "The Eighth Expedition"
  giga_birch.8001.a: "Our goal is in sight."
  giga_birch.8001.desc: "Our failure to locate another control center during the seventh expedition has led, in multiple ways, to further understanding of the Structure network map. Firstly, additional readings from the site of the observatory have allowed us to narrow our list of candidate sites, and secondly the observatory itself has provided some of the computing power required to refine our models.\n\nThe eighth expedition, to be lead by Expedition Leader [giga_birch_expedition_leader.GetName], will travel to the most likely candidate site yet."
  giga_birch.8002: "Questions of Scale"
  giga_birch.8002.a: "This looks promising."
  giga_birch.8002.desc: "Expedition Leader [giga_birch_expedition_leader.GetName] reports that the expedition has arrived at their destination, and though a particularly heavy storm is currenting bearing down on the convoy's location, they have made visual contact with an artificial structure which may be the command center we are looking for.\n\nIt is attached to a spire like the first, but the shape is significantly different, being much larger, yet simpler overall. Once the storm passes, exploration proper will commence."
  giga_birch.8003: "A Spatial Conundrum"
  giga_birch.8003.a: "A fascinating design."
  giga_birch.8003.b: "We must be patient. This may be the final piece of the puzzle."
  giga_birch.8003.b.desc: "Researching the £physics_research£ §Y$giga_tech_tetradimensional_engineering$§! Technology will allow us to continue this line of investigation."
  giga_birch.8003.desc: "Our [GigaGetExplorerPlural] have come across something unusual. The layout of the structure they were sent to explore has features indicative of a four dimensional design, using an artificial three dimensional manifold to have a larger internal space than the exterior dimensions would allow.\n\nIt seems that the systems maintaining the manifold have malfunctioned, collapsing the thresholds leading inside, leaving corridors abruptly cut off by perfectly smooth walls.\n\nWith our knowledge of four dimensional architecture, it should be a simple matter to repair the damaged systems and gain access to the space within."
  giga_birch.8003.desc.wait: "Our [GigaGetExplorerPlural] are at a loss. The layout of the structure they were sent to explore simply makes no sense.\n\nCorridors end abruptly in perfectly flat surfaces without apparent purpose. Live power conduits terminate in ways that could not possibly form a closed circuit. The few signs we can still discern point into puzzling alcoves and dead ends.\n\nExpedition Leader [giga_birch_expedition_leader.GetName] suggests there may be more going on here than we can see, and that we should continue to hunt for clues to the method behind this madness."
  giga_birch.8004: "Seeing Things From a New Angle"
  giga_birch.8004.a: "Suddenly it all makes sense."
  giga_birch.8004.desc: "As our understanding of dimensional physics has grown, the mysteries behind the control hub and its peculiar design have dwindled day by day. It is now obvious to even a casual inspection by our [root.GetResearchers] that its structure is four dimensional, which in retrospect is an expected design choice.\n\nIt shouldn't take long to gain access now."
  giga_birch.8005: "True Depth"
  giga_birch.8005.a: "We must find a functional collector!"
  giga_birch.8005.desc: "Expedition Leader [giga_birch_expedition_leader.GetName] reports that repairs on the structure our expedition has been investigating are now complete. The systems maintaining its disjointed three dimensional manifold have been restored, and we can now access the space within.\n\nInside, our [GigaGetExplorerPlural] have found exactly what we were looking for: a major command hub. From here, we will be able to restart the Structure's repair systems and begin the process of restoration.\n\nBefore that, however, we must revive the Structure's heart.\n\nThe command hub has shown us that the flow of energy and raw materials is barely enough to maintain the Structure as-is, so we must go down even further. We must travel to the supermassive black hole itself, to repair the great gravity bores and collectors hanging above its event horizon."
  giga_birch.8006: "Assuming (In)direct Control"
  giga_birch.8006.a: "Imagine what will be possible..."
  giga_birch.8006.desc: "We're nearly there. The most important part is still ahead of us, but with the control hub restored we now have a much higher degree of control over the Structure's systems. Despite the extremely low power levels throughout the network, we can redirect energy and materials from less important areas to our homeland to revive yet more of the automated systems.\n\nThe gains to productivity are sure to be significant, and we expect that they would be even greater once the Structure is fully restored."
  giga_birch.801: "Ancient Accessways"
  giga_birch.801.a: "A sealed door is a good sign."
  giga_birch.801.desc: "A series of access corridors in a rarely visited section of the arcology have led our [owner.GetArchaeologistPlural] to a huge blast door which appears to separate a large section of the platform from the complex at large.\n\nThis might be some kind of secure data repository or other sensitive area."
  giga_birch.802: "Mapping the Extents"
  giga_birch.802.a: "Leave no stone unturned."
  giga_birch.802.desc: "The blast door has been opened, and the area within is now being mapped out. A huge section of the arcology appears to have been dedicated to some kind of digital archive, but the advanced state of decay evident throughout the structure may mean that there's nothing left to find."
  giga_birch.803: "Dilapidated Servers"
  giga_birch.803.a: "We're lucky the archive is at least partially intact."
  giga_birch.803.desc: "A room has been found deep within the archive containing a number of seemingly intact records. The layout of the area around it and low level of security measures suggests that it is of no particular import, more forgotten than specifically preserved.\n\nOur [owner.GetArchaeologistPlural] are decoding the contents, but due to the level of damage, piecing together anything of use may take some time."
  giga_birch.804: "A Trove of Schematics"
  giga_birch.804.a: "We could use this knowledge to colonize other planets..."
  giga_birch.804.b: "... or repurpose it to build space habitats instead."
  giga_birch.804.desc: "The efforts to piece together usable data from the remains of the archive have finally yielded some results.\n\nIt appears that this particular section was used to store the schematics for the arcology and other similar facilities! They are incomplete due to deterioration of the storage media, but even this limited glimpse into the minds of its architects is sure to be incredibly valuable."

  giga_birch.9001: "The Ninth Expedition"
  giga_birch.9001.a: "The final piece of the puzzle."
  giga_birch.9001.desc: "Since the reactivation of the control hub during the eighth expedition, our [GetResearchers] have been scouring the Structure's network plan to find an extraction array to focus our efforts on.\n\nNearly all of them have either totally failed or are too essential to their local systems to disable, making repairs a tricky proposition. In this state, the whole Structure might have only have a few centuries left before catastrophic failure... It's a terrifying proposition, but one which makes our mission all the more important.\n\nExpedition Leader [giga_birch_expedition_leader.GetName] will head up the operation to seek out and repair the gravity bore and collector system deemed most suitable for restoration."
  giga_birch.9002: "Teetering on the Edge of Oblivion"
  giga_birch.9002.a: "Incredible."
  giga_birch.9002.desc: "As our [GigaGetExplorerPlural] complete their descent and enter the final, lowest layer of the Structure, they are struck with awe.\n\nBefore them, an endless forest of collection equipment dangles down. Below, the infinite inky depths stretch out.\n\nIt is cold here, and a deafening silence presides over the caged god at the Structure's heart.\n\nBarely a hundred kilometers separates the expedition from the rapidly spinning event horizon, a number which seems laughably tiny compared to the black hole's immensity. The scale and precision of the engineering required to build something like this are truly mind-boggling, and we are humbled to be its inheritors."
  giga_birch.9003: "The Dormant Gravity Bore"

While the others are either visibly damaged, or simply motionless, this one is showing signs of being at least minimally functional.\n\nIf the technology involved proves to be as closely related as it looks, the restoration process should be relatively straightforward."
