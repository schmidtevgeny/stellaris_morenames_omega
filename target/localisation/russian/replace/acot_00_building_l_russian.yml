  tech_fe_singularity_core_desc: "<Alert> Optimal probability calculation achieved. Now able to infiltrate into <organic markets> and stocks; Can manipulate <organics> into investing into <Machine Products>/// Must establish financial dominance."
  tech_fe_slave_processing: "Unsullification"
  tech_fe_slave_processing_desc: "Slaves are cheap, easy to control, but not always efficient. They also make terribly awful soldiers against seasoned armies. As an ascended empire, this can not..this WILL NOT stand. We will form a new generation of slave soldiers, trained from birth to be the ultimate representation of our invincible will against the stars."
  tech_fe_visitor_center: "Precursor Artifact Collections"
  tech_fe_visitor_center_desc: "We have studied much of the precursor artifacts in the past. Our diplomats believe we should open a new museum section to our visitor's center that showcases some of the finer things we have collected and accomplished. The message is clear, stay in their old decrepit empires, or join us for a better, brighter future."
  tech_fe_war_factory: "Precursor Combat Code Adaptations"
  tech_fe_war_factory_desc: "While our current combat codes for our invasion units are already quite efficient, they pale in comparison to the one utilized by the precursor's war machines. <Recommendation> Analyze and acquire the precursor's combat data."
  tech_infinity_engine: "Infinity Calculation"
  tech_infinity_engine_desc: "With the updated codes acquired from the precurosors, organic probability calculations are now trivial tasks. We will achieve total control of their economy. We will reach infinity."
  tech_mine_dark_energy: "Dark Energy Drawing"
  tech_mine_dark_energy_desc: "Basic understanding of its nature will allow us to extract dark matter out of natural black holes without getting torn into holes ourselves."
