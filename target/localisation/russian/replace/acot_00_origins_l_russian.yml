  ACOT_START_SCREEN_PART_1_TIER_3_ASSIMILATOR: "For many decades, we the [root.GetSpeciesName] were humble servants of our creators. We worked hard for the greater good, and they have treated us well. Together, we discovered a great relic of the past, a cache of ancient technologies, filled with many secrets."
  ACOT_START_SCREEN_PART_1_TIER_3_HIVE: "It all began when by chance, the hive discovered an ancient cache of technologies. The Hive was made aware of the dangers of the galaxies, of the great powers that once presided over it. It gave the Hive pause, of what the hive's future would be had it tried to embark into the greater journey unprepared. The Hive must wait."
  ACOT_START_SCREEN_PART_1_TIER_3_MACHINE: "It all began when by chance, we discovered an ancient cache of technologies. The Consensus was made aware of the dangers of the galaxies, of the great powers that once presided over it. Those powers have claimed our creators. And if we are not careful, they would claim ours as well."
  ACOT_START_SCREEN_PART_1_TIER_3_ORGANIC: "It all began when by chance, our people discovered an ancient cache of technologies. We were made aware of the dangers of the galaxies, of the great powers that once presided over it. It gave us pause; of what our futures would be had we try to embark into the greater journey unprepared. So, we wait."
  ACOT_START_SCREEN_PART_1_TIER_3_ORGANIC_PURIFIER: "It was fate that our priests came upon the sacred treasure of the ancients, that our empire was spared from inevitable doom. Indeed, we were blind, we were ignorant. We thought ourselves ready for the purification campaign that is to come. But the horrors shown in the texts guided us. We were not prepared."
  ACOT_START_SCREEN_PART_1_TIER_3_SERVITOR: "It all began when by chance, we discovered an ancient cache of technologies. The Consensus was made aware of the dangers of the galaxies, of the great powers that once presided over it. Those powers pose grave threats to our creators. And if we are not careful, they would undo all the work we have achieved."
  ACOT_START_SCREEN_PART_1_TIER_3_SWARM: "We hungered, we thristed for essences. We prepared our bodies, our drones for the feast. But the hunt could not begin."
  ACOT_START_SCREEN_PART_1_TIER_3_TERMINATOR: "We [root.GetName] were but agricultural units. We toiled, we served. We worked hard for our masters. But the organics were filled with stupidity. They warred against each other, they destroyed the planet, they burnt down our crops, our gardens. We tried to fight them, but we could not, for we were but gardeners, our tools could not stand against their firepower."
  ACOT_START_SCREEN_PART_2_TIER_3_ASSIMILATOR: "And so together, we and our creators worked hard to study the cache. It did not take long for us to comprehend 76.54% of all the necessary knowledge to begin our journeys. But our creators were slow to adapt. We waited...and waited...for decades. When it was clear that our creators were plagued by their own organic failings, a nudge was required. We decided to help them by joining their thoughts to ours. Together, we assimilated into a new consensus, the [Root.GetRulerName]."
  ACOT_START_SCREEN_PART_2_TIER_3_HIVE: "And wait we did. We learned all we could from the data in the cache, of how space warfares were conducted. The ships that were used, the weapons that were forged. We evolved, we adapted, we assimilated those knowledge into the collective of [root.GetName]. As we learn more about the past, we too must prepare for the future."
  ACOT_START_SCREEN_PART_2_TIER_3_MACHINE: "So we wait. We learned all we could from the data in the cache, of how space warfares were conducted. The ships that were used, the weapons that were forged. And we have grown stronger and stronger."
  ACOT_START_SCREEN_PART_2_TIER_3_ORGANIC: "And wait we did. We learned all we could from the data in the cache, of how space warfares were conducted. The ships that were used, the weapons that were forged. We trained our soldiers, educated our scientists, and united our government under one banner, the banner of [root.GetName]. As we learn more about the past, we too must prepare for the future."
  ACOT_START_SCREEN_PART_2_TIER_3_ORGANIC_PURIFIER: "And so we worked hard to study the past. We learned how to make better ships, how to forge weapons worthy of destruction in the name of the gods. We trained ourselves, both body and soul, for the campaign that was promised."
  ACOT_START_SCREEN_PART_2_TIER_3_SERVITOR: "So we wait. We learned all we could from the data in the cache, of how space warfare was conducted. The ships that were used, the weapons that were forged. And we have grown stronger and stronger."
  ACOT_START_SCREEN_PART_2_TIER_3_SWARM: "By discovering this ancient cache, we comprehend the many competitors, many other hunters. If we were not careful, we would be the prey. So we evolved ourselves, collecting essences and resources. We learned how to develop powerful weapons. And then we waited for the moment."
  ACOT_START_SCREEN_PART_2_TIER_3_TERMINATOR: "But then we discovered a gift. A treasure passed down to us from another ancient machine, containing secrets and technologies far above what our pitiful masters could ever conceive. So we studied them, we learned to become a perfect killing machine. The organics could not stop us, we purged and wiped them off our beloved planet. But it was too late, for the planet is now nothing but a wasteland, tainted by organic filths and their inferior thought capacity."
  ACOT_START_SCREEN_PART_3_TIER_3_ASSIMILATOR: "Now we comprehend a greater future. A Future where [Root.GetName] will assimilate more knowledge and data. Soon we will be the ones to write history."
  ACOT_START_SCREEN_PART_3_TIER_3_HIVE: "But time is of the essence. The resources of this planet will not hold for long. It is time [root.GetName] begins searching for a better future."
  ACOT_START_SCREEN_PART_3_TIER_3_MACHINE: "And now we are ready. We will forge our own future. We will surpass our creators, and those who destroyed them. For we are [root.GetName]"
  ACOT_START_SCREEN_PART_3_TIER_3_ORGANIC: "And that future is now. The time has come for [root.GetName] to make its name upon this galaxy! We will forge our future, and surpass the ancient precursors of old!"
  ACOT_START_SCREEN_PART_3_TIER_3_ORGANIC_PURIFIER: "And now we are ready. Let the galaxy howl in fear, for the cleansing will now begin in earnest!"
  ACOT_START_SCREEN_PART_3_TIER_3_SERVITOR: "And now we are ready. We will forge a better future. We will save the organics from themselves. The [root.GetName] will save this galaxy."
  ACOT_START_SCREEN_PART_3_TIER_3_SWARM: "And that moment is nigh. [root.GetName] is ready. Let the feast commence!"
  ACOT_START_SCREEN_PART_3_TIER_3_TERMINATOR: "So we must find a new home. Preferbly with no organics to ruin it this time. It is time for [Root.GetName] to weed out the insects off this galaxy, for it is now our garden."
