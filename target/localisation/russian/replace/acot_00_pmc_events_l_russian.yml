  acot_pmc.1003.b.response: "Formidible would be an understatement. Because the enemy agent is hiding there, all of their availiable units will likely gather up at the most fortified position. You must assemble the biggest and most formidable invasion force as you can muster and take the garrison down. Remember to use the forces we will provide, they are standing ready at the Drop Point itself.\n\nOh, and be aware that while the Vault has built-in self repair mechanisms, it may not be enough to stop damage coming from more powerful weapons, so try to avoid using armies with...you know...lots of collateral damages."

  acot_pmc.7.d.response: "Naturally, although it may seem unconvential and perhaps a bit hard to comprehend by customers such as you. But suffice to say, the Corps are very interested in maintaining certain...status quos between the powers across the galaxies. But rest assured, we are not a threat to those who would not seek our aggression first. We are a neutral party, and prefers to remain so."
  acot_pmc.7.desc: "Redirecting to Inquiry Channel. Приветствую! What would you like to know about us, dear customer?"
  acot_pmc.7.e: "What services do you actually provide?"
  acot_pmc.7.e.response: "Various type of services, ranging from commissions, sabotages, information and other more...unorthordox things. The control panels will give you the rough idea of what the Corps can provide for you. Do be aware that services will be suspended should hostile actions be taken, but that should be common senses."
  acot_pmc.7.f: "How large is the Phanon Corps?"
  acot_pmc.7.f.response: "Larger than you may realize. You should already be able to guess that our reach expands beyond the local stars if our portals are not a dead giveaway enough. But that is all you need to know. We are many, and we will never truly be outnumbered, that is all that matters."

  acot_pmc.900.a: "We will prevail."
  acot_pmc.900.b: "They cannot stop us."
  acot_pmc.900.desc: "Be it by design or not, our aggression against the Phanon Corps has resulted in a hostile response. We are now officially at war with this mysterious organization. We believe that understanding the Corp's technological capabilities will be crucial to any ongoing battle. Unfortunately, most of their components break down and self-destruct upon destruction of the ship, so we will not be able to directly analyze any of their ship's debris.\n\nHowever, we believe that if we can destroy enough of their ships, our researchers may yet be able to form a pattern and develop countermeasures around their encrypted systems, allowing us to develop new components using a combination of our own technologies and theirs."

  acot_pmc.9001.b.tooltip: "Rather than trying to implement their technologies, we should be developing ways to counter them. All fragments will be drained to grant a temporarily enhancement to our weapons against the Corps until they develop ways to counter our algorithms. Any future fragments will simply be converted into alloys instead, with the ratio of 100 alloys per fragment."
  acot_pmc.9001.desc: "Our battles against the Corps have given us an opportunity to study how their mysterious technology work. While almost all of their equipments break down upon destruction, likely as part of self-destruct mechanism, there're multiple fragments that can be studied. With enough luck, we may be able to develop new technology by combining these fragments with our own Alpha components to even up the playing field.\n\nAlternatively, we can simply liquify these components into raw materials and insert their data into our combat computer's targeting systems, which will make it easier for us to damage their ships in battle for awhile."

  acot_pmc.9953.a: "What do you know of the Corps?"
  acot_pmc.9953.a.response.mat: "That they have much more powerful techs and materials and ships? That much should be obvious to anyone. But somehow their designs are rather...simple? Like there's not a lot of complexity behind it, it's just like...well...whatever your empire uses to fly your ships these days. And how can they be so reckless with the amount of automatons in their armies? What even controls those bionic \"dutymen\" of theirs? Psionic Networks? Biochips? So many questions.\n\nPerhaps after our victory, these questions will finally be answered."
  acot_pmc.9953.a.response.phile: "Very little, we're afraid. They do not use technology that we recognize, and they pretend to be running a PMC business, but anyone with a brain knows that's a farce. They have spies everywhere, always watching, always collecting data. But to what end, we do not know. But we always anticipate that one day, they will reveal their true natures. And now that they have, they must be stopped at all costs."
  acot_pmc.9953.a.response.phobe: "If you really need to know, they came to this galaxy as a foreign invader, stealing one of the systems and turn it into the accursed abomination of theirs. They told us that they would only observe and watch. Others may buy into that crap, but not us. Not the [contact_empire.GetName]. We always knew that one day they would no longer have a use for our galaxy. Why else would they keep such an impressive military presence if not to one day conquer the known galaxy?\n\nWe say take the fight to them, steal the portal of theirs and blow up whatever is on the other side of it to oblivion."
  acot_pmc.9953.a.response.spirit: "They are parasites! They claim to be nothing more than a corporation running legitimate business, but behind that facade lies a mad scheme to harvest our minds and souls. We [contact_empire.GetName] can feel it, the massive psionic energy that they accumulate every second from us, from this galaxy. It is time we put a stop to their mad ritual and destroy these apostates."
  acot_pmc.9953.b: "Can you really stop them?"
  acot_pmc.9953.b.response.mat: "Maybe if we defeat them fast enough before they pull out more of their reinforcements. You should distract them while we prepare our forces. We have come this far, survived many onslaughts, defeated many foes. This one will not be any different.\n\n§YA slight change of tone near the end implies they are not as confident in their victory as they seem to portray.§!"
  acot_pmc.9953.b.response.phile: "Perhaps not alone. But we're sure that if the entire galaxy works together under our leadership, we can twart any oppositions.\n\n§YThey may speak truth about working together, but are they the one to lead?§!"
  acot_pmc.9953.b.response.phobe: "You should be more worried about yourself, plebs. We'll have you know that we do not plan to save you or anyone else, you're assets, meant to be used to exploit the weaknesses in the Corps. I suggest you do the same to others. Let the cannon fodders die so that you can make the preparations for the decisive blow."
  acot_pmc.9953.b.response.spirit: "If not with might, then with faith and psionic might shall we prevail against our foes. But faith requires more than our prayers and words, we require supporters. If you wish to survive this crisis, you'll do well to aid us."
  acot_pmc.9953.desc.mat: "Damn...too soon. Too soon! We were hoping they'd take more time before we analyzed their weaknesses.\n\nBut that no longer matters, what we have will be enough. The Phanon Corps is a threat to the galaxy for their reckless uses of dangerous unproven weapons and technologies. They must be destroyed, and their assets confiscated."
  acot_pmc.9953.desc.phile: "Ah, so they finally decided to make their evil moves? It is as we suspected. The Corps cannot be trusted any further can they be thrown, which is not very far, mind you.\n\nBut now that it has come to this, it is up to us once again to rid the galaxy of the evils that corrupt this place. Defend yourselves, [root.GetName], for this battle will not be an easy one."
  acot_pmc.9953.desc.phobe: "Of course, the stupid shady bastards turned mad. Why are we always correct about these type of things?\n\nIf you don't want to get caught in this mess, then you better stay out of our ways. Leave the serious matters to those who have the power to resist."
  acot_pmc.9953.desc.spirit: "So the Corps have shown their true colors, at last?\n\nThese faithless corpo scums must be expunged from the galaxy. [root.owner.species.GetNamePlural], join us as we cleanse these foreign intruders once and for all."
