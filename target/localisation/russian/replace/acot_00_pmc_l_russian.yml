  tech_phanon_bb: "Corps Mainline Ship Access Code"
  tech_phanon_bb_desc: "Star Devastators are mainline ships used by the Corps. They are well-equipped for both offense and defense. Devastators are the Corps' largest non-capital ship."
  tech_phanon_cruiser: "Corps Escort Ship Access Code"
  tech_phanon_cruiser_desc: "Star Destroyers appear to be the smallest battleship within the Corps Fleet. They field smaller weapons and are expected to engage small ships and assist in picket duty. They are still relatively well-equipped enough to fight against bigger ships though."
  tech_phanon_fighter: "Corps ISC Access Code"
  tech_phanon_fighter_desc: "Phanon Strikecraft Squadron equipped with independant FTL. They appears to be using neural networks to pilot. The Corps use them in place of smaller picket ships."
  tech_phanon_mothership: "Corps Flag Ship Access Code"
  tech_phanon_mothership_desc: "Initially only the Annihilator counts as a Flagship for the Corps. The Dominator II has only been recently elevated to be a more economical alternative for Agents that wish to spend less budgets. Both ships are the largest traditional military ships an agent is cleared to deploy in a level-2 galaxy."
  tech_phanon_operative: "Phanon Field Operative Study"
  tech_phanon_operative_desc: "Perhaps one of the most mysterious yet frighteningly powerful secret of the Corps's army, the Field Operatives act as final defenses against any intruders. They appear to possess both biological and mechanical components in nature, but perhaps the most noticable feature is their elaborate fashion-over-form design. Each Operative have custom-made attires and are visually quite distinct from one another, suggesting that they may also serve in various other duties beyond combat.\n\nRegardless of the design, they are still extremely deadly combatant, and the appearance they hold deceptively hide the many arsenals in their disposal and the attires they wear are surprsingly durable, its material even stronger than some vehicle's armors yet still very light in weight. Cracking the codes will be difficult and there's only three Operatives left within the Vault."
  tech_phanon_operative_repeatable: "Phanon Operative Reconstruction"
  tech_phanon_operative_repeatable_desc: "With no Operatives left for us to activate, the only way to acquire more is to study from the data and attempt to create a new template. This will not be an easy task, as the built-in security system will make our tasks harder with every attempt to reconstruct the genetic templates."
  tech_phanon_plat_l: "Heavy Orbital Defense Access Code"
  tech_phanon_plat_l_desc: "Heavy Fortresses that are expensive to build but can ward off most intruders on its own."
  tech_phanon_plat_m: "Light Orbital Defense Access Code"
  tech_phanon_plat_m_desc: "Medium Defense Stations used by the Corps, primarily geared towards general purpose defenses."
  tech_phanon_titan: "Corps Capital Ship Access Code"
  tech_phanon_titan_desc: "Star Dominators and Decimators are both classified as Capital Ships. The former is geared towards direct assault while the former serves as artillery ship. They are often used by the Corps to lead smaller battle groups."
  tech_plasma_pe: "Phi Plasma Cannon"
  tech_plasma_pe_desc: "We are yet to determine what substances or catalysts were used to make the Corps's Plasma Weaponry. But at least we can make use of their superior engineering of the turret design itself."
  tech_plasma_re: "Runic Plasma Cannon"
  tech_plasma_re_desc: "Final version of the Plasma Cannon that is based on the Corps schematics. Despite showing signs of psionic energies, the weapon itself is not."

  tech_point_defense_pe: "Phi PDS"
  tech_point_defense_pe_desc: "These Point-Defenses seem to rely on some sort of precognitive systems as well as signs of temporal manipulation to increase their performance, but one we have yet to fully understand."
  tech_point_defense_re: "Runic PDS"
  tech_point_defense_re_desc: "It seems clearer now that these weapons, just like many other Runic energy weapons, rely on a strange psionic power to not only cause damage, but to assist in tracking and nullifying enemy defenses."
  tech_precursor_phanon_design: "Runic Precursor Adaptation"
  tech_precursor_phanon_design_desc: "Lets try a new approach."
  tech_precursor_phanon_design_pe_1: "Preliminary Phi Tech Analysis"
  tech_precursor_phanon_design_pe_1_desc: "Despite the overwhelming scale and firepower displayed by the Phanon Corp's armada, it seems that many of their technologies are not that inherently arcane in their designs. Most of their equipment self-destruct upon the destruction of the ship, however, so we can only make do with studying some little debris that may be analyzed."
  tech_precursor_phanon_design_pe_2: "Intensive Phi Tech Analysis"
  tech_precursor_phanon_design_pe_2_desc: "The extra fragments and debris recovered, coupled with the observed behaviors of the Phanon's weapon systems, allow us to make a more intensive analysis on their technologies. Obviously, we are still nowhere close to understanding the real power source, but we are confident that this will give us additional insight into how their ships operate."
  tech_precursor_phanon_design_pe_3: "Through Phi Tech Analysis"
  tech_precursor_phanon_design_pe_3_desc: "With all the data and fragments gathered, a final through analysis of the Phanon ships should be doable. This will finally allow us to create a full spectrum of Phi-based technologies inspired from the Phanon Corps. Completion of this analysis will also pave a long way to our eventual true understanding of the Corp's mysterious power."
  tech_sensor_pe: "Phi Bionic Sensors"
  tech_sensor_pe_desc: "Although the tech behind this sensor seems to be based around Enigmatic detection, just like Alpha, it seems to harbor strange secrets. As if the sensors is showing not just where the enemy could be, but also...what it could have been, or what it once was?"
  tech_sensor_re: "Runic Sensors"

  tech_strike_craft_bomber_pe: "Phi Bombers"

  tech_strike_craft_bomber_re: "Runic Bombers"
  tech_strike_craft_bomber_re_desc: "It is clear now that there's some kind of bionic computer, perhaps that of a dutyman that acts as subroutine computer. This may explains why the virtual pilots experience strangeness when interfacing with the systems. But the effectiveness is undeniable."
