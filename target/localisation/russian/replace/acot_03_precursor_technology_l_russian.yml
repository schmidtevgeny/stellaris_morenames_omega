Yet the design seemed sloppy, uncompleted. For the longest of times we theorized it to simply be due to old age, but this design plans have given us new revelations; the origin of the citadel itself was not invented by any of the fallen ones.\n\nTheir lack of proper understanding of Dark Matter and Energy forced them to cut down on many of the design's promising features. Ultimately, the station they have now is nothing more than a replica, built to look impressive to scare younger races. But now it is time we show the fallen ones the difference between perfection and pretension.\n\nDue to the station's complex mechanisms, the framework must be constructed as part of a megastructure before the real work can begin."

  tech_precursor_colonizer_desc: "During the ancient galactic-scale war known as the Ascension War, planets became major playing grounds for all factions and little to no unoccupied planets were left untouched. The inconveniences of deploying large invasion fleets on planet surfaces to eradicate surface resistances, followed up by the lengthy process of re-colonization of the planet caused the  Precursors to revisit their approach to expansion. The Emissary is a massive mobile colonization vessel that carries massive cities and armies that could in theory, be literally deployed on the surface. After which the massive terraforma device will quickly reconfigure the planet's ecosystem through dimensional manipulation and matter reconstitution.\n\nThe lack of any Emissaries in use by the Fallen Ones seem to suggest the project never came to fruition, and the standard colonizer is used to colonize new planets instead due to its simpler and easy-to-replicate materials."

The ship is massive enough that it can support two primary reactors and has a built-in self-repair protocol that allows it to repair its hull to full conditions as soon as it reaches critical damage for the first time. The \"Colossus\" portion makes up the inner layer of the station. It seems the fallen empire decided to strip down the original design and only utilized the Colossus Section for their world-altering weapons.\n\nThis does not make a lot of sense...why would the fallen precursors decide to give us this schematics? Perhaps they think that we won't be able to build such a massive vessel? Is there a hidden exhaust port somewhere that may blow up the ship in one hit? We can only guess."
