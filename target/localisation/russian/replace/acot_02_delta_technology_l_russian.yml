In the past, trying to tackle these issues typically results in massively increasing the costs or alterations of the ship's overall physical shapes that make them unfeasible.

This caused a major change resulting in most following civilizations to somehow forget many other kind of strikecrafts such as interceptors and bombers. Our strategist's face turn pale; Why had we ignore such an obvious thing? It is like the way we decided to create an entirely new type of corvette that looks the same, except it fires missiles and then we call it frigates.\n\nRegardless, this error should be rectified. Strike Crafts now appear in various designs, from interceptors which are designed to hunt down other strike crafts and provide screening against missiles, to bombers which acts as dedicated anti-ship surgical striker, to fighters which are a hybrid of both. May our brains never be melted, and the questionable actions of the Persues Intercorp never be forgotten."

The records we studied shows a good case to be made for dedicated dog-fighters that not only ace against enemy strike crafts, but also function as point-defenses, targeting enemy missiles and protect their motherships."
  tech_swarmer_missile_dm: "Delta Cluster Missiles"
  tech_swarmer_missile_dm_desc: "Delta Cluster Missiles are guided with limited bionic link allowing it to achieve higher speed, velocity and can perform basic evasive maneuvers, making them extremely difficult to shoot down."
  tech_thrusters_dm: "Sub-Light Thrusters Optimization"
  tech_thrusters_dm_desc: "The new generation-thruster that we will soon be implementing will not only be faster, but also more modular. This allows the thrusters to achieve maximum speed and evasion across all ship types."
  tech_titan_accelerator_dm: "Titan Delta Accelerator "
  tech_titan_accelerator_dm_desc: "The newly improved acceleration systems and fortified railways permits us to finally develop kinetic accelerators on a titanic-scale with performance befitting its size."
  tech_titan_emitter_dm: "Delta Titan Stabilized Emitter"
  tech_titan_emitter_dm_desc: "Just like with other weapons, the inclusion of the two dark elements greatly enhance our arsenals, and a titan emitter is one of them."
  tech_torpedo_dm: "Delta Torpedoes"
  tech_torpedo_dm_desc: "Delta Torpedoes are protected with hard-light armor and contain powerful dark energy that will explode upon impact, making it superior to older torpedoes."
  tech_xl_missile_dm: "Delta HSPM"
  tech_xl_missile_dm_desc: "Our fleet commanders will certainly be delighted that they now have a much more improved spinal-based explosive weapon as an option, one that is more reliable than the original design."
